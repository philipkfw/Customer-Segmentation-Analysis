## Executive Summary:
Our 'client' runs a supermarket and has gathered basic data of their customers through issuing membership cards. Our goal is to better understand these customers in a way that will be useful for our client's marketing team. Some of the key questions we'll be covering in our analysis are;

- Who are our target customers with whom our marketing team should focus their efforts?
- Will gender-based classification help with our analysis?
- Which variable(s) should we consider that will lead to higher spending scores?
